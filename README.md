# ADOFAI-2PlanetsTo3Planets

[![standard-readme compliant](https://img.shields.io/badge/readme%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/RichardLitt/standard-readme)

A single python file that could automatically turn a 2-planets ADOFAI level to a 3-planets ADOFAI level.

## Background

In the Steam Workshop, there're really a lot of levels that just turn two planets to three planets. That's not very creative and I think that these kinds of levels should be OK to convert automatically. And here we are!

The file's goal:

  Convert a 2-planets ADOFAI level to a 3-planets ADOFAI level.

## Usage

python 2PlanetsTo3Planets.py <./main.adofai>

<./main.adofai> means a path to a .adofai file which should be an ADOFAI level.

## Changelog

2022/8/2:  Add a whole new panel that you can choose from-planet amount and to-planet amount.

2022/7/28: Fix that the degree isn't correct when a hold is less than 60°. 

2022/7/26: Add a GUI version. 

2022/7/18: Add several options and their help. Converting 3 planets to 3 planets now gives warning. 

2022/7/14: Add support for holds which more than 1 lap.
