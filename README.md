A single python file that could automatically turn a 2-planets ADOFAI level to a 3-planets ADOFAI level.

## Background

In the Steam Workshop, there're really a lot of levels that just turn two planets to three planets. That's not very creative and I think that these kinds of levels should be OK to convert automatically. And here we are!

The file's goal:

  Convert a 2-planets ADOFAI level to a 3-planets ADOFAI level.

## Usage

python 2PlanetsTo3Planets.py <./main.adofai>

<./main.adofai> means a path to a .adofai file which should be an ADOFAI level.
